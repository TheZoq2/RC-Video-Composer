# RC Video Composer

This project involves putting a Raspberry PI Zero on a 1:8th scale R/C
nitro powered buggy. This Raspberry PI records video while collecting sensor
data from a Teensy LC, which records the speed of the car, the engine 
temperature and the throttle and steering servo positions. The video and
sensor data are then fed through a python script which composes the data
into a video with the sensor data visualised.
